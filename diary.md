# Diary
## Have to do
- Exploratory Data Analysis
    - About each data.
- Learn catboost.
    - What is it?
    - What can I do to improve it?
- Add EEG data to train CatBoost.

## Question
- When the EEG data is aggregated by eeg_id,
    - The total numbers of votes are the same?
    - Expert_consensus is all same over the eeg_id?

## Discovery
- Batch size: 512 + GPU P100 -> Did not work (out of memory)
