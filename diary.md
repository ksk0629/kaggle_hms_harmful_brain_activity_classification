## Have to do
- Exploratory Data Analysis
    - About each data.
- Learn catboost.
    - What is it?
    - What can I do to improve it?
- Add EEG data to train CatBoost.

## Question
- When the EEG data is aggregated by eeg_id,
    - The total numbers of votes are the same?
    - Expert_consensus is all same over the eeg_id?

## 22/01/2024
- Submitted the baseline with `catboost.ipynb`.
- Downloaded the paper of CatBoost, but probably should study data first.
